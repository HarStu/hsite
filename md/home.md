# hi, my name is harrison

i also sometimes go by 'moncrief'

i'm a software engineer, dual us-canadian citizen, and english literature graduate. i like pro-social technology, ambitious literature, armchair phenomenology, home cooking, and difficult games.

recently, i moved from canada to nyc to take part in the [fractal ai accelerator](https://fractalbootcamp.com/) program. i'm falling in love with this city and hope to stay here for the forseeable future
