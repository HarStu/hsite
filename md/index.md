# H Moncrief

Hi, my name is Harrison. I also go by my middle name, 'Moncrief'. This is my website. You'll have to forgive the simplicity -- it's a work in progress. 

A bit more about me -- I'm a software engineer, a dual US-Canadian citizen, and a former english literature student. I'm interested in prosocial technology, ambitious literature, armchair phenomenology, difficult games, emergent behavior, and home cooking

Recently, I moved from Canada to NYC to take part in the [Fractal AI Accelerator](https://fractalbootcamp.com/) program. I'm falling in love with this city and hope to stay here for the forseeable future

My recent long-form writing is located [here](./essays.html)

I'm currently looking for interesting work in NYC, preferably with a startup. You can find my resume [here](./public/HarrisonStuartResume.pdf). If you're a founder who has a problem I might enjoy working on, I'd love to chat about doing a short-term externship with you! You can reach me at the email in my resume
