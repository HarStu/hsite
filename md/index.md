Hi, my name is Harrison. I also sometimes go by my middle name, 'Moncrief'

I'm a software engineer, a dual US-Canadian citizen, and a former english literature student. I like pro-social technology, ambitious literature, armchair phenomenology, difficult games, home cooking, and simulated sandboxes

Recently, I moved from Canada to nyc to take part in the [Fractal AI Accelerator](https://fractalbootcamp.com/) program. I'm falling in love with this city and hope to stay here for the forseeable future

My longer-form writing is located [here](./essays.html)

I'm also currently looking for a job in nyc, preferably at an early stage startup. You can find my resume [here](./public/HarrisonStuartResume.pdf)
