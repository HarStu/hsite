# H Moncrief

Hi, my name is Harrison. I also go by my middle name, 'Moncrief'. This is my website -- it's a work in progress.

I'm a software engineer, a dual US-Canadian citizen, and a former english literature student. I'm interested in prosocial technology, ambitious literature, armchair phenomenology, difficult games, emergent behavior, and home cooking.

Recently, I moved from Canada to NYC to take part in the [Fractal AI Accelerator](https://fractalbootcamp.com/) program. I'm falling in love with this city and hope to stay here for the forseeable future.

My recent long-form writing is located [here](./essays.html).
