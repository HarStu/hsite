# H Moncrief

Hi, my name is Harrison. I also sometimes go by my middle name, 'Moncrief'

I'm a software engineer, a dual US-Canadian citizen, and a former english literature student. I'm interested in pro-social technology, ambitious literature, armchair phenomenology, difficult games, home cooking, and emergent behavior

Recently, I moved from Canada to NYC to take part in the [Fractal AI Accelerator](https://fractalbootcamp.com/) program. I'm falling in love with this city and hope to stay here for the forseeable future

My recent long-form writing is located [here](./essays.html)

I'm currently looking for a job in NYC, preferably at a startup. You can find my resume [here](./public/HarrisonStuartResume.pdf). I'm also available for short-term externships while enrolled in the AI Accelerator. If you're a founder with a problem you think I might enjoy working on, I'd love to chat (email in resume).
