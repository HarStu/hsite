    <h1>3rd strike</h1>
    <p>street fighter iii: 3rd strike is the final entry in capcom's street fighter iii series.
    <p>it's widely considered one of the best 2d fighters ever made. it's also my personal favorite.</p>
    <p>i play 3rd strike, competitively, on-and-off. i'm hugely grateful for the efforts of the jazzy circuit, who've done an amazing job keeping the competitive fire going, 25+ years after the games' release.</p>
    <p>i consider myself very intermediate. i play urien, and my best tournament placement is 17th at evo 2024</p>
    <p>fighting games are fascinating and exciting. learning to become a competent 3rd strike player taught me a lot of hard-knock lessons about myself. </p>
